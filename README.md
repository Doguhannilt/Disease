<h1>Overview</h1>
The "Finding the disease based on symptoms" project is an innovative and crucial application of artificial intelligence in the healthcare domain. The primary objective of this project is to provide users with a powerful tool that can assist in identifying potential diseases or health conditions based on the symptoms they report. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques, this project aims to offer a preliminary screening system that encourages users to seek professional medical advice promptly.

<h1>Model and Accuracy</h1>
In this project, we have employed the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for modeling the disease diagnosis system. KNN is a well-known machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. The accuracy achieved by our KNN model is an impressive 80%, indicating its potential to make reasonably accurate predictions based on symptom inputs.

<h1>Dataset</h1>
For training and evaluating our disease diagnosis model, we utilized a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset, "Doctor Specialist Recommendation System," contains a collection of health-related information, including symptoms and corresponding diseases. The data has been preprocessed and formatted to suit the requirements of our machine learning model. You can find the dataset at the following link: <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/code/ebrahimelgazar/doctor-s-specialty-recommendation-system">Dataset Link</a>

<h1>Benefits and Limitations</h1>
This project offers several significant benefits:

  <li>Accessibility: Users can access the system from the comfort of their homes or on-the-go, enabling faster and more convenient preliminary assessments of their health status.</li>
  
  <li>Early Awareness: By encouraging users to be proactive about their health, the system promotes early detection of potential health issues, leading to timely medical intervention.</li>
  
  
  <li>Public Health Impact: Prompt medical attention, facilitated by the system, has the potential to reduce the severity of certain illnesses and improve overall public health outcomes.</li>
  
 </lu>
 <br>
 However, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations:
 <br>
 <lu> 
  <li>Not a Replacement for Medical Professionals: The system does not substitute the expertise of medical professionals. Its results should be used as informative guidelines rather than definitive diagnoses.</li>
  
  <li>Accuracy: While the KNN model aims to provide accurate predictions, its reliability may vary based on the quality and quantity of data it has been trained on.</li>

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
It's essential to remember that this disease diagnosis system is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for a comprehensive evaluation and proper medical care. This project is designed to complement medical expertise and empower users to take an active role in their healthcare journey.

We hope that this disease diagnosis project can be a valuable tool in promoting early detection and improving healthcare accessibility. Your feedback and contributions are welcomed to further enhance the system's accuracy and effectiveness.
