      <h2>What is AIDS?</h2>
      <p>
        Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a severe stage of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) infection. It weakens the immune system, making it challenging for the body to fight off infections and diseases.

      <h2>Transmission of HIV</h2>
      <p>
        HIV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, sharing of contaminated needles, and from an infected mother to her child during childbirth or breastfeeding. It is NOT transmitted through casual contact like hugging or shaking hands.

      <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        In the early stages of HIV infection, people may experience flu-like symptoms. As the disease progresses to AIDS, more severe symptoms and opportunistic infections may occur due to a weakened immune system.

      <h2>Prevention and Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Prevention measures include practicing safe sex, using clean needles, and getting tested regularly. Early diagnosis and timely medical care can help manage HIV and slow the progression to AIDS. There is currently no cure for HIV/AIDS, but antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control the virus and improve the quality of life for individuals living with HIV.

      <h2>Risk of Complications</h2>
      <p>
        While early diagnosis and proper treatment can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with HIV, untreated HIV can progress to AIDS and lead to severe complications. Regular medical care, adherence to medication, and a healthy lifestyle are crucial in managing HIV and reducing the risk of complications.
