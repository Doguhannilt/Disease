      <h2>What are Allergies?</h2>
      <p>
        Allergies are the body's immune system's response to substances that are typically harmless to others. When an allergic person comes into contact with an allergen, the immune system overreacts, leading to various allergic reactions.

      <h2>Prevention and Management</h2>
      <p>
        Avoiding known allergens is the best way to prevent allergic reactions. For some allergies, over-the-counter antihistamines may help manage mild symptoms. Individuals with severe allergies should carry an epinephrine auto-injector and seek immediate medical attention in case of severe reactions.

      <h2>Risk of Severe Allergic Reactions</h2>
      <p>
        While many allergic reactions are mild, some individuals are at a higher risk of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) that can be life-threatening. It is crucial for those with severe allergies to be prepared and take necessary precautions.
