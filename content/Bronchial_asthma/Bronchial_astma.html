      <h2>What is Bronchial Asthma?</h2>
      <p>
        Bronchial Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes the airways in the lungs to become inflamed and narrowed. This leads to recurring episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing.

      <h2>Causes and Triggers</h2>
      <p>
        Asthma can be triggered by various factors, including allergens (e.g., pollen, pet dander), respiratory infections, air pollution, tobacco smoke, exercise, cold air, and certain medications. It often has a genetic component as well.

        Common symptoms of asthma include wheezing (a whistling sound during breathing), shortness of breath, coughing (especially at night or early morning), and chest tightness. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may vary over time.

      <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
      <p>
        Asthma can be managed through a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and avoiding triggers. Long-term control medications help prevent symptoms, while quick-relief (rescue) medications provide relief during asthma attacks. It's essential to work with a healthcare provider to develop an asthma action plan.
