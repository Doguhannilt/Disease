      <h2>What is Cervical Spondylosis?</h2>
      <p>
        Cervical Spondylosis is a common degenerative condition that affects the cervical spine (neck region). It is caused by the wear and tear of the cartilage and bones in the neck over time. As we age, the discs between the vertebrae lose moisture and become less flexible, leading to cervical spondylosis.

        <li>Smoking</li>
        <li>Occupations involving repetitive neck movements</li>

        <li>Obesity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        If you experience persistent neck pain or other symptoms, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional. The diagnosis may involve physical examination, imaging tests (X-rays, MRI), and neurological evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment options for cervical spondylosis include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physical therapy and exercises</li>
        <li>Medications for pain and inflammation</li>
