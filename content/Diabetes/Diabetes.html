      <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
      <p>
        Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). It happens when the body either doesn't produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot use insulin effectively (Type 2 diabetes). Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar and helps the body use it for energy.

      <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
      <p>
        There are several types of diabetes, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> Typically develops in childhood or adolescence. The immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to little to no insulin production.</li>
        <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> More common in adults, but can also occur in children and adolescents. The body becomes insulin resistant, and the pancreas may not produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> Occurs during pregnancy, affecting blood sugar levels. It usually resolves after childbirth but increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Diagnosis of diabetes involves blood tests to measure fasting blood sugar levels and oral glucose tolerance tests. Treatment aims to manage blood sugar levels effectively, and it may include lifestyle changes (healthy diet, regular exercise), oral medications, insulin therapy (for Type 1 diabetes or when other treatments are ineffective), and continuous glucose monitoring.
