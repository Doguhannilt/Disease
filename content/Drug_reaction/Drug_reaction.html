      <h2>What are Drug Reactions?</h2>
      <p>
        Drug Reactions, also known as Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), are unintended and harmful effects caused by medications. They can occur when using prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal supplements. ADRs can range from mild side effects to severe and life-threatening conditions.

      <h2>Types of Drug Reactions</h2>
      <p>
        Drug Reactions can be categorized into several types, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Type A (Augmented) Reactions:</strong> Predictable reactions related to the drug's known pharmacological effects. These are dose-dependent and common side effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Type B (Bizarre) Reactions:</strong> Unpredictable reactions not related to the drug's known pharmacological effects. These are usually not dose-dependent and can be severe or rare.</li>
        <li><strong>Type C (Chronic) Reactions:</strong> Related to prolonged use of a drug, leading to cumulative damage or organ toxicity.</li>
        <li><strong>Type D (Delayed) Reactions:</strong> Occur after a significant time lag from the drug's administration and may be difficult to attribute to the drug.</li>
        <li><strong>Type E (End-of-treatment) Reactions:</strong> Reactions that occur upon stopping a drug, such as withdrawal effects or rebound symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Type F (Failure) Reactions:</strong> Result from the drug's failure to provide the intended therapeutic effect.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        The signs and symptoms of drug reactions can vary widely based on the type of reaction and the individual's response. Common symptoms may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives)</li>
        <li>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</li>
        <li>Dizziness or drowsiness</li>

      <h2>Prevention and Management</h2>
      <p>
        To prevent drug reactions, it's essential to provide a comprehensive medical history to healthcare providers and inform them of any allergies or previous adverse reactions to medications. It's also crucial to take medications as prescribed and to avoid self-medicating or sharing medications with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a drug reaction occurs, it's essential to seek medical attention promptly. Treatment may involve discontinuing the offending medication, providing supportive care, or administering medications to counteract the reaction.
