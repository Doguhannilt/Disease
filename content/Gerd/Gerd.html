      <h2>What is GERD?</h2>
      <p>
        Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is a chronic condition in which stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing irritation and inflammation. This can lead to symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing. GERD is a common digestive disorder and can cause discomfort and complications if left untreated.

      <h2>Symptoms of GERD</h2>
      <p>
        Common symptoms of GERD include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heartburn (burning sensation in the chest)</li>
        <li>Regurgitation (acid or food coming back up into the throat)</li>
        <li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>
        <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
        <li>Chronic cough or hoarseness</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>
        GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a ring of muscle between the esophagus and stomach, weakens or relaxes inappropriately, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus. Certain factors can increase the risk of developing GERD, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Obesity or being overweight</li>
        <li>Hiatal hernia</li>
        <li>Pregnancy</li>
        <li>Smoking</li>
        <li>Consuming certain foods or beverages, such as spicy, fatty, or acidic items</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
      <p>
        Treatment for GERD often involves lifestyle modifications and medications to reduce stomach acid production. Lifestyle changes may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eating smaller, more frequent meals</li>
        <li>Avoiding trigger foods and beverages</li>
        <li>Quitting smoking</li>
        <li>Elevating the head of the bed</li>
        <li>Weight loss (if necessary)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In more severe cases, medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers may be prescribed. In some instances, surgery may be recommended to strengthen the LES or repair a hiatal hernia.
