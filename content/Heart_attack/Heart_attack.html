      <h2>What is a Heart Attack?</h2>
      <p>
        A heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction (MI), occurs when there is a sudden blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle. It is often caused by the formation of a blood clot in a coronary artery, which supplies blood to the heart. Without adequate blood flow, the heart muscle can be damaged, leading to serious complications.

      <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>
        The primary cause of a heart attack is the buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) in the coronary arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis. Various risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing a heart attack, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
        <li>High cholesterol levels</li>
        <li>Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke</li>
        <li>Diabetes</li>
        <li>Obesity</li>

        <li>Family history of heart disease</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment and Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Immediate treatment for a heart attack involves seeking emergency medical care. Early intervention can help minimize heart muscle damage and improve outcomes. Treatments may include medications, such as blood thinners and clot-busting drugs, and medical procedures, such as angioplasty and stent placement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preventive measures to reduce the risk of heart attacks include adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle, managing risk factors, eating a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and avoiding tobacco products.
