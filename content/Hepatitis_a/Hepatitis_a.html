      <h2>What is Hepatitis A?</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. It is commonly transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis A is a self-limiting disease, and most people recover without any long-term complications. However, in some cases, it can cause severe liver inflammation and require medical attention.

      <ul>
        <li>Inadequate handwashing</li>
        <li>Consumption of contaminated food or water</li>

      <h2>Treatment and Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A, and the infection usually resolves on its own. Supportive care is provided to manage symptoms and ensure adequate hydration. Rest and a healthy diet are recommended during the recovery period.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to prevent hepatitis A is through vaccination. Practicing good hygiene, including frequent handwashing, and avoiding contaminated food and water can also help reduce the risk of infection.
