      <h2>What is Hepatitis B?</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can lead to both acute and chronic liver disease and puts individuals at risk of developing severe complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis B can be transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person.

      <h2>Treatment and Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Treatment for acute hepatitis B is generally supportive, with a focus on rest and adequate nutrition. In some cases, antiviral medications may be prescribed. For chronic hepatitis B, antiviral therapy may be recommended to suppress the virus and reduce the risk of liver damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to prevent hepatitis B is through vaccination. It is essential to practice safe sex, avoid sharing needles or personal items that could be contaminated with blood, and consider vaccination if at risk.
