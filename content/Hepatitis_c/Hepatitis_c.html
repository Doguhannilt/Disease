      <h2>What is Hepatitis C?</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis C is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and can lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer if left untreated. Hepatitis C is usually spread through contact with infected blood, but it can also be transmitted through sexual contact and from mother to child during childbirth.

        Hepatitis C is primarily transmitted through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Injection drug use and sharing of needles</li>
        <li>Receiving contaminated blood or blood products (prior to blood screening)</li>

      <h2>Treatment and Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Advances in medical treatment have made it possible to cure hepatitis C in many cases. Antiviral medications are now available that can effectively clear the virus from the body and prevent further liver damage. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prevention of hepatitis C involves avoiding exposure to infected blood and practicing safe behaviors, such as not sharing needles or personal items that may be contaminated with blood.
