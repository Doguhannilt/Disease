      <h2>What is Hepatitis D?</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis D, also known as delta hepatitis, is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV). It is considered a "satellite" virus because it can only infect individuals who are already infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Co-infection with both hepatitis B and hepatitis D can lead to more severe liver disease compared to infection with HBV alone.

      <h2>Symptoms of Hepatitis D</h2>
      <p>
        Symptoms of hepatitis D are similar to those of hepatitis B and may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li>

      <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which can only infect individuals who are already infected with hepatitis B (HBV). It is primarily transmitted through contact with infected blood or other body fluids.

      <h2>Treatment and Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        There is currently no specific antiviral treatment for hepatitis D. However, managing hepatitis B infection with antiviral medications may also help in controlling hepatitis D. In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to prevent hepatitis D is through prevention of hepatitis B. This includes getting vaccinated against hepatitis B and practicing safe behaviors to avoid exposure to infected blood and body fluids.
