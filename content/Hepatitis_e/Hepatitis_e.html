      <h2>What is Hepatitis E?</h2>
      <p>
        Hepatitis E is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). While most cases of hepatitis E are self-limiting and resolve on their own, the infection can be severe and even life-threatening, especially in pregnant women and individuals with pre-existing liver disease.
