      <h2>What is Hypertension?</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the arteries. It is a significant risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, strokes, and kidney problems. Hypertension can be managed through lifestyle changes, medication, and regular monitoring.

      <h2>Symptoms of Hypertension</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertension is often referred to as the "silent killer" because it usually does not cause noticeable symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage. Some individuals with hypertension may experience symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or nosebleeds, but these are not reliable indicators of high blood pressure.
