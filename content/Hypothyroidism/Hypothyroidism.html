      <h2>What is Hypothyroidism?</h2>
      <p>
        Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. These hormones are essential for regulating metabolism, energy levels, and various bodily functions. Hypothyroidism can cause a range of symptoms and may require lifelong management with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

      <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
      <p>
        Hypothyroidism is typically managed with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. This involves taking synthetic thyroid hormones (levothyroxine) to restore normal hormone levels in the body. Regular monitoring of thyroid function is essential to adjust the medication dosage as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lifestyle changes, such as a balanced diet and regular exercise, can also support overall health and well-being for individuals with hypothyroidism.
