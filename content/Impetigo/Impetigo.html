      <h2>What is Impetigo?</h2>
      <p>
        Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection that primarily affects young children. It is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Impetigo is often characterized by red sores or blisters that rupture and form a honey-colored crust. It can be easily transmitted through skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated items.
