      <h2>What is Malaria?</h2>
      <p>
        Malaria is a life-threatening mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and remains a significant public health concern in many parts of the world.

      <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>
        Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, and the risk of infection is higher in regions where the Anopheles mosquitoes thrive. Factors that increase the risk of malaria include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traveling to or residing in malaria-endemic areas</li>
        <li>Not using mosquito nets or insect repellents</li>
        <li>Lack of immunity in non-endemic populations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment and Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential for managing malaria. Antimalarial medications are used to treat the infection, and the choice of drug depends on the type of Plasmodium parasite and the severity of the illness. Preventive measures include using mosquito nets, wearing protective clothing, using insect repellents, and taking prophylactic medications when traveling to high-risk areas.
