      <h2>What is a Migraine?</h2>
      <p>
        A migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by recurring moderate to severe headaches, often on one side of the head. Migraine headaches are usually pulsating or throbbing and can last for hours to days. In addition to headache pain, migraines may be accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and sound.
