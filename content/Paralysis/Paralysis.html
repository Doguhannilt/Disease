      <h2>What is Paralysis?</h2>
      <p>
        Paralysis is the loss of muscle function in part of the body due to damage or injury to the nervous system. It can affect one or more muscles and may be temporary or permanent, depending on the underlying cause. Paralysis is often classified based on the affected body part, such as quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs) or paraplegia (paralysis of the lower body).
