      <h2>What is Pneumonia?</h2>
      <p>
        Pneumonia is a lung infection that can affect one or both lungs. It can be caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Pneumonia leads to inflammation of the air sacs in the lungs, causing them to fill with fluid or pus. This can make breathing difficult and lead to a range of symptoms.
