      <h2>What is Psoriasis?</h2>
      <p>
        Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by the rapid buildup of skin cells, resulting in thick, red, and scaly patches on the skin's surface. It is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy skin cells. Psoriasis can affect various parts of the body and may cause discomfort and itching.
