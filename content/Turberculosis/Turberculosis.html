      <h2>What is Tuberculosis?</h2>
      <p>
        Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can also target other parts of the body. TB spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. It is a significant global health concern, and early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent its spread.
