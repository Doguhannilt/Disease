      <h2>What is Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)?</h2>
      <p>
        A Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) is an infection that can occur in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Most UTIs affect the lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) and are more common in women. UTIs are usually caused by bacteria and can cause discomfort and pain.

      <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Female anatomy (shorter urethra, closer to the anus)</li>
        <li>Sexual activity</li>
        <li>Use of certain birth control methods (e.g., diaphragm)</li>
        <li>Menopause</li>
        <li>Urinary tract abnormalities or blockages</li>

      <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
      <p>
        UTIs can be treated with antibiotics. It is essential to complete the full course of treatment prescribed by a healthcare provider to ensure the infection is fully cleared. Drinking plenty of water and practicing good hygiene can also help prevent UTIs.
