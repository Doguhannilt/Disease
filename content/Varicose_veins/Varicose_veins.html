      <h2>What are Varicose Veins?</h2>
      <p>
        Varicose veins are enlarged and twisted veins that usually appear blue or dark purple. They commonly occur in the legs and can be seen through the skin's surface. Varicose veins are caused by weakened valves and veins, which can lead to the pooling of blood and the formation of bulging veins. While they are generally harmless, they may cause discomfort and cosmetic concerns.
